/**
 * MDC stands for Mapped Diagnostic Context.
 * It helps you to distinguish inter-leaving logs from multiple sources,
 * such as multiple user-requests coming in for a given servlet.
 * In this scenario each request of an user is serviced using a distinct thread,
 * which leaves multiple users logging to the same log file and the log
 * statements get inter-mixed.
 * So, if you use log4j for logging, then each thread can have itâ€™s own MDC
 * which is  global to the entire thread.
 * Thus, MDC helps to distinguish those log messages in a non-invasive way
 * by allowing us to put the user-id (and other information) in a context-map
 * which is attached to the thread (of each user request) by the logger.
 * MDC is thread-safe and uses a Map internally to store the context information.

    How to use MDC?
    a. Configure the information, which needs to be logged (user-id in this case) in the log4j.xml as part of ConversionPattern.
    b. In your respective class, before you start processing the user request, place the actual user-id in the context(MDC).
    c. Remove the context information from MDC at the end of the processing.
